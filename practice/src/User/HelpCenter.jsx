                <p>
                  To maintain fairness and allow equal access to rooms, each user is limited to one reservation per day whether you are the main reserver or added as a participant. This rule applies even if the reservation was rejected or canceled.
                </p>

              <div>
                <p className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-1">Can participants reserve too?</p>
                <p>
                  Yes, participants can also reserve but only if they haven't already joined another reservation that day. Once you're involved in any reservation (even as a participant), the system will block you from creating or joining another on the same day.

              <div>
                <p className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-1">Why do I need to be verified?</p>
                <p>
                  Verification ensures that only legitimate University of San Agustin students and faculty use the system. Your ID must be verified before you can create a reservation or be added as a participant. Unverified accounts will not be allowed to reserve.

              <div>
                <p className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-1">What time ranges are allowed?</p>
                <p>
                  Reservation times follow the library's open hours. You can choose hourly blocks within the allowed time range, but you cannot overlap existing reservations. The system will only accept valid time slots that do not conflict with others.
